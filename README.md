# "Geographic" Bicubic Splines

This is a repository of code used to create bicubic splines to fit samples of 2D grid data.

This isn't perfectly organized, as it is a proof-of-concept and I am planning on creating a more comprehensive, usable suite of tools for this purpose in the future.

See https://maxcandocia.com/articles/2024/Oct/14/sampled-bicubic-spline-fitting for how this code was used.

A few tips for running the code:

* Start with smaller matrices.

* Use `gc()` if R/RStudio seems to be slowing down

* You might need a lot of RAM

* It isn't perfectly optimized. That will be in a future repository which I will link here.
